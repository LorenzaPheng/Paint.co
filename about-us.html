  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>To inspire creativity and make art accessible to everyone.<br>
We're here to help young artists in Aotearoa feel confident exploring their creativity. Art doesn't need to be expensive, perfect or something you learn only at school. Whether you're painting on canvas, sketching with graphite or learning how to use watercolour for the first time, this space is for you.<br><br> Our goal is to make learning art feel simple and welcoming. A lot of people are told they’re not creative or not good at drawing, but we don’t buy into that. Everyone starts somewhere. What matters is that you’re curious and willing to try. We’re not here to turn you into a professional artist overnight. We just want to give you the right tools and guidance to help you grow, at your own pace.</p>

<div id="team" class = "about-section">
  <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
  <p>We are a small, dedicated team of artists and educators.<br>We’re a small team made up of artists, teachers and creative people who care about making art more accessible. Some of us have been drawing since we were kids, others came to art later in life. We’ve worked in schools, run local workshops and spent plenty of time figuring things out through trial and error.<br><br>We all remember what it felt like to start out and not know if what we were doing was any good. That’s why we take a supportive approach to everything we do. We’re not here to be art critics or tell you the right way to do something. We’re here to encourage you, share what we’ve learned and help you enjoy the process.</p>

<div id="values" class = "about-section">
  <h2>Our Values</h2>
  <p>Creativity, inclusivity, and continuous learning.<br>We believe creativity belongs to everyone. You don’t have to be the best in your class or have all the gear to be an artist. What matters is showing up, trying something new and sticking with it even when it feels hard.<br><br>One of our main values is openness. That means creating a space where people can learn, ask questions and be themselves without feeling judged. We want this to be a place where you feel safe to try things, make mistakes and figure it out as you go.</p>
